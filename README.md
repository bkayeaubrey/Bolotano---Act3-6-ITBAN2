Activity 4 - Asynchronous Programming: 
Develop a Dart program that asynchronously fetches data from an API (e.g., weather data), processes the response, and displays relevant information to the user. 
 
Activity 5 - Error Handling and Exception Management: 
Create a Dart program that reads a user-provided file name, attempts to open and read the file, and prints its contents. Implement error handling to catch and handle potential file I/O errors gracefully. 
 
Activity 6 - Data Structures Implementation: 
Implement a stack data structure in Dart. Define a class Stack with methods push, pop, and isEmpty. Then, use this class to perform stack operations like pushing and popping elements.
